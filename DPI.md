# DPI (Dot Per Inch)
## What is DPI
It is a concept that is being used in typography (Printing). It describes how many dots can be striked in one inch.  
The bigger the value is, the better the printing quality. (Easy to understand, right?)
## DPI of monitors or other displays?
When we say DPI of monitors. We actually meant PPI.
## DPI of an image
When people say this. The DPI here is PPI actually.  
Note: The PPI here does not define an image's resolution. It instructs how big the image will be printed.  
For example.  
A 3000 pixels by 2000 pixels image, using 1000 PPI. The result is a 3 * 2 inchs image will be printed.
