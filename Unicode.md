# What is Unicode
Unicode is character set that defines characters being used in most of the writing systems.   
Almost all known characters have their corresponding code point (Thinking of this as assigned ID/Number).   
E.g. Exclamation mark (!) code point in Unicode is: U+0021
# Why does it exist
Before Unicode, there were a lot of different character sets, and the most known one is ASCII. The issue was they are all very small and have limited number of characters defined.  
Back then, software/people using one encoding system have a lot of issues communicating with another software/people using another encoding system. And there were a lot of encoding issues (Question marks in emails, and other documents).  
Then the Unicode appeared, trying to solve such situation.
